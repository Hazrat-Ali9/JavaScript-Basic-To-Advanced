# What is Javascript and how can i learn it ?

 JavaScript is a programming language that's mainly used to make websites interactive and dynamic. It runs in your browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), and it powers features like sliders, pop-ups, form validation, animations, and even full web apps like Google Docs or Spotify.

# 🚤 1. What is a Function in JavaScript?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
In this case, we want a function that adds two numbers.

    function add(num1, num2){
    const sum = num1 + num2;
    return sum;
}
    
    const result1 = add(12, 13);
    // console.log()
    const result2 = add(35, 7);
    const finalResult = add(result1, result2);
